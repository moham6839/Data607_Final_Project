## My observation

After our finding, we see that in term of clutch performances, San Antonio Spurs have the highest winning percentage during the regular season. However, it does not paint a good picture that Spurs is the better team. We decided to use the plus/minus to see the net change when a given player is either on or off the court for each team.

Based on that, we can see Dallas Maverick have higher PLUS/MINUS than San Antonio Spurs. It could mean that Maverick have better players than other teams overall. That mean their players can score better during clutch moments. So we decided to review the average points per game in that sense.
