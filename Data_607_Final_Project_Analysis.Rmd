# Introduction

The pressure of winning games can affect the performances of players and their respective teams. For this analysis, we will focus on the performance of players and teams during clutch situations, exploring how their performances are affected by pressure situations. More specifically, do teams/players perform better or worse from the regular season to the playoffs? 

The term "clutch" is defined as a situation when a game is within 5 points in the final 5 minutes. We will examine data that compares team clutch stats with non-clutch stats, focusing specifically on the regular season. Additionally, we will also analyze regular season and playoff clutch performances for both teams and players, respectively. The data we collected centered on 20 NBA seasons for team statistics from 2001-2002 to 2021-2022, and 10 NBA seasons for players from 2011-2012 to 2021-2022. We will use traditional statistics such as field goal and free throw percentages, win percentage, total points, and plus/minus, which measures whether the score margin increased or decreased with the team or player on the court. While there are numerous amounts of advanced stats, we will use only two metrics for this analysis: true shooting percentage, which uses field goal and free throw attempts to calculate a team and player's shooting percentages, and turnover rate, which is calculated utilizing turnovers, field goal and free throw attempts. This data was obtained using the hoopR and nbastatR libraries.
